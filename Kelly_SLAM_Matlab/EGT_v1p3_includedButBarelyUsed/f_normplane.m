%  f_normplane     Normal versor of a plane.
%
%  [plane,flag] = f_normplane(X1,X2);
%  X1,X2 = vectors belonging to the plane; the normal versor to the plane 
%          is defined as the cross product between X1 and X2.
%
%  Descr: 
%  -----  Given two vectors, this function computes the normal versor to the 
%         plane to which the vectors belong.
%  
%  plane = f_normplane(X1,X2) returns in the 3by1 vector 'plane' the normal
%  versor to the plane where the vectors X1 and X2 lie. If X1 and X2 are 
%  linearly dependent the plane is not defined, in this case the function 
%  assigns to the variable 'plane' the not valid value [0,0,0]'.
%  [plane,flag] = f_normplane(X1,X2) returns flag=0 if the two vectors 
%  X1 and X2 are linearly dependent or flag=1 if they are independent.
