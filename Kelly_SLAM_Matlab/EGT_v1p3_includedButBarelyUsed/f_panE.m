% f_panE(H1,H2) returns the essential matrix E=R*S for panoramic camera with
% hyperbolic mirror, where R is the rotation matrix between two camera and 
% S is the skew-symmetric matrix of translation vector between two camera
% 
% H1 = Homogeneous matrix containing rotation R respect to EGT frame and 
%      translation vector t respect to world frame of first camera
